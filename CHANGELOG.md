## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 0 — repository scaffold: CDK v2 Python app (`infra/`, `uv`-managed, Python 3.13),
  Go module for the `agg` CLI (`cli/`), Vite + TypeScript SPA skeleton (`web/`), and the
  component directories from design §11 (`policy/`, `cost/`, `meter/`, `lti/`, `agent/`,
  `ingest/`, `docs/`). `README.md`, this changelog, `.gitignore`, and `cdk bootstrap` notes.
- Phase 1 — identity broker + ABAC:
  - Pure, side-effect-free `claims_to_tags()` translation (the `agg:` session-tag scheme,
    §13.1) with full unit-test coverage and no AWS dependency.
  - Single-source-of-truth tier → entitled-model-ARN table, shared by the broker and the
    generated IAM model-access policy.
  - `infra/stacks/identity.py`: Cognito **Identity Pool** (federated SAML/OIDC, no User
    Pool), the authenticated role + permissions boundary keyed on `agg:` principal tags,
    and the per-request **broker Lambda** that validates the IdP token, derives the four
    tags, and vends scoped STS credentials.
  - Phase 1 end-to-end proof: IAM policy simulation asserting `Converse` is allowed for an
    entitled model ARN and denied for a non-entitled one, scoped purely by `agg:` tags.
- Phase 2 — static SPA, Tier 0 browser-direct transport:
  - `web/src/auth/credentials.ts`: `CredentialManager` that fetches scoped STS credentials
    from the broker and refreshes them before expiry, with a pure, unit-tested
    `shouldRefresh()` decision and concurrent-refresh coalescing.
  - `web/src/transport/bedrock.ts`: the Tier 0 adapter implemented — browser-direct
    `ConverseStream` signed with the scoped credentials, streaming answer text and a
    separate reasoning channel (for reasoning models such as gpt-oss), with final token
    usage for the non-authoritative client-side cost estimate.
  - `web/src/chat/session.ts`: in-memory `ChatSession` over the transport (no persistence
    yet); reasoning is shown live but never persisted to history.
  - Minimal streaming chat UI wired in `web/src/main.ts`; build-time config in
    `web/src/config.ts` (no secrets in the client).
  - Vitest unit tests for the refresh decision, message mapping, and chat accumulation;
    an opt-in live `ConverseStream` smoke test (`AGG_LIVE_SMOKE=1`), verified against
    Bedrock.
- Phase 3 — data plane (S3 Vectors RAG):
  - `infra/stacks/data.py`: an `agg-docs` S3 bucket (per-tenant prefix, versioned,
    retained), an S3 Vectors vector bucket with one **index per tenant** (1024-dim,
    cosine), and a **per-tenant KMS CMK** on each index. Each index is tagged with its
    `agg:tenant` so the Phase 1 ABAC data-scope policy isolates reads. Built on L1
    `Cfn*` constructs (no L2 for S3 Vectors yet).
  - `ingest/handler.py`: embed-on-upload Lambda — S3 `ObjectCreated` → chunk → Bedrock
    Titan embeddings → `PutVectors` into the tenant's index. Tenant is derived from the
    key prefix and fails closed; one bad object never aborts the batch.
  - `agg/rag.py`: pure, AWS-free chunking, tenant-key derivation, and vector-record
    assembly with full unit-test coverage.
  - `web/src/rag/`: query-embed → scoped `QueryVectors` on the tenant index → context
    injection; a pure, unit-tested context builder. RAG is opt-in via an optional
    `ContextProvider` on `ChatSession` (grounding is sent per turn, never persisted).
  - Tenant-isolation proof (IAM policy simulation): a `chem`-scoped session may
    `QueryVectors` its own index and is **denied** the `psych` index (both directions).
- Phase 4 — LTI 1.3 tool provider:
  - `agg/lti.py`: pure, AWS-free mapping of an LTI 1.3 launch (roles, context, NRPS)
    into the claims dict that the Phase 1 `claims_to_tags()` consumes — so LTI is one
    concrete source of `agg:affiliation` / `agg:courses`, with no second tag scheme.
    Instructor → faculty (mid tier), Learner → student (oss); plus pure nonce/state
    replay-protection decisions.
  - `lti/handler.py`: the four LTI 1.3 endpoints (`/lti/login`, `/lti/launch`,
    `/.well-known/jwks.json`, `/lti/deeplink`) on one Lambda. The launch path
    RS256-verifies the platform id_token against its JWKS and enforces
    `iss`/`aud`/`exp`/`nonce`/`state` (single-use), failing closed on every check;
    the validated claims are handed to the SPA for exchange at the Phase 1 broker.
  - `infra/stacks/lti.py`: HTTP API + Lambda + two DynamoDB on-demand tables
    (platform registrations; short-lived state/nonce with a TTL attribute). The
    Lambda asset bundles PyJWT+cryptography via a local (Docker-free) bundler.
  - Tests sign tokens with an in-test RSA keypair to exercise the real RS256 path:
    valid launch, replayed state, nonce mismatch, tampered signature, expired token,
    and wrong audience are all covered.
- Academic interaction model (§10.2) — spec added under `docs/`.
- Academic interaction model — Phase 1 (event protocol + SPA panes):
  - `web/src/events/protocol.ts`: the run event protocol — the `pane` field on
    `model`, and the new `divergence`, `citation`, and `artifact` events, alongside
    the existing `route`/`answer`/`code`/`chart`/`cost`/`receipt`/`guardrail`/
    `policy_denied` events. Additive and backward-compatible; transport-agnostic
    `Emit` contract (browser, CLI runner, and test collector share it).
  - `web/src/events/collector.ts`: an `EventCollector` sink plus a pure
    `reduce()` / `runStateFrom()` that folds an ordered event stream into render
    state (Panel panes keyed by label, single-stream Ask answer, Analyze cells,
    divergence, running cost). Unknown event types pass through (forward-compatible).
  - `web/src/panes/render.ts`: framework-free rendering of the multi-pane Panel
    layout, the side-by-side divergence view (agreement/disagreement/unsupported
    with a verify flag), and the notebook-style editable, re-runnable Analyze cell.
  - Vitest tests (fakes only, no AWS): the event collector, the reducer over Panel/
    Ask/Analyze runs, backward-compatibility with unknown events, and the divergence
    and Analyze-cell rendering.
- Academic interaction model — Phase 2 (Panel orchestration + adjudicator contract):
  - `agg/panel/schema.py`: the `Divergence` Pydantic model mirroring the §10.2.5
    draft-07 schema (forbids extra properties, requires ≥1 position per claim,
    constrains the stance/kind enums) plus `strip_fences()` for accidental Markdown
    fences around the adjudicator's JSON.
  - `agg/panel/prompts.py`: the `ADJUDICATE_SYSTEM` prompt (structured-only output)
    and a default review prompt; reviewer labels are roster config, kept neutral.
  - `agg/panel/orchestrator.py`: `run_panel` — N roster members review the same
    evidence in parallel over injected `Backend`/`CostMeter` interfaces (no AWS in
    core), each emitting its own `model` start/done + per-pane `cost`; the
    adjudication tail validates the structured output and emits a `divergence`
    event, falling back to an unstructured `answer` on malformed/invalid output.
  - Tests (fakes only, no AWS): per-pane events, identical evidence to every
    member, a well-formed adjudication whose `pane` values are a subset of the
    roster labels, cost accumulation, and the malformed- **and** schema-invalid-
    adjudicator fallback paths.
- Academic interaction model — Phase 3 (Analyze cell / Code Interpreter):
  - `agg/analyze/schema.py`: pure, AWS-free `extract_code()` (pulls the Python
    script from the model's fenced output), `parse_invoke_result()` (normalises an
    AgentCore `InvokeCodeInterpreter` stream result into text/image content blocks),
    and `result_to_events()` (maps a result to `answer`/`chart` events, surfacing a
    traceback on error rather than swallowing it).
  - `agg/analyze/prompts.py`: the `ANALYZE_SYSTEM` prompt (one self-contained,
    network-free Python script; chart saved to a known path for inline rendering).
  - `agg/analyze/orchestrator.py`: `run_analyze` over injected `Backend` /
    `CodeRunner` (the Code Interpreter microVM) / `CostMeter` — generate → emit the
    editable `code` cell → execute in the sandbox → emit `answer`/`chart`. Execution
    time is metered as a **compute** line distinct from token cost (`add_compute`),
    and the re-run path accepts edited code and skips generation.
  - Tests (fakes only, no AWS): generate→code→chart ordering, the re-run path
    skipping generation, compute-vs-token metering separation, and the error path.
- Academic interaction model — Phase 4 (multimodal knowledge base):
  - §10.2.7 Phase-0 verification gate completed first (issue #17): confirmed
    `amazon.nova-2-multimodal-embeddings-v1:0` (TEXT/IMAGE/AUDIO/VIDEO → embedding,
    **3072-dim**), S3 Vectors as a first-class Bedrock-KB backend
    (`s3_vectors_configuration`), and the supplemental multimodal-storage location.
  - `agg/multimodal.py`: pure, AWS-free helpers — the Nova embedding request/response
    mapping, ingestion-path selection (native multimodal vs parser+text fallback),
    and visual-citation resolution (`citation` event + figure/table corpus deep links).
  - `infra/stacks/data.py`: a **3072-dim multimodal S3 Vectors index per tenant**,
    built alongside (not replacing) the 1024-dim text index, sharing the tenant CMK
    and `agg:tenant` tag; a `_mm-artifacts/` supplemental-storage prefix. Embedding
    dimension is now per-index config, not a global constant.
  - `web/src/rag/multimodal.ts` + `citation.ts`: query-by-image and figure-aware
    text retrieval against the multimodal index, and visual-citation/deep-link
    resolution mirroring the Python helpers.
  - Tests (fakes only, no AWS) across Python and TypeScript: embedding request
    shapes, path selection, the 3072-vs-1024 dimension guard, and citation/deep-link
    resolution for text vs figure vs table.
- Academic interaction model — Phase 5 (reproducible run artifact):
  - `agg/artifact.py`: pure, AWS-free `RunArtifact` Pydantic model + `build_artifact()`
    that folds a run's typed event stream into one shareable, citable record — mode,
    question, panel roster, models used, transcript, generated code, citations (text
    and visual), the divergence structure (reusing the `Divergence` model), and the
    receipt. `receipt_to_csv()` exports a chargeback-tagged receipt (grant/course
    code) and `to_json()` the canonical record; `created_at`/`run_id` are inputs
    (no clock in core).
  - `web/src/events/artifact.ts`: a browser "save run" `serializeRun()` mirroring the
    Python artifact shape, plus a matching `receiptToCsv()` (CSV-escaped, tagged).
  - Tests (fakes only) across Python and TypeScript: full Panel/Analyze stream
    capture, deduped models in first-seen order, JSON round-trip, canonical
    none-omission, the cost-tag CSV export, and forward-compat with unknown events.
- Academic interaction model — Phase 6 (router + mode override), completing §10.2:
  - `agg/router.py`: pure `classify_mode()` (a router model's one-word reply →
    SYNTHESIS/DEBATE/ANALYSIS, robust to noise, cue-word fallback, never escalating
    past the cheapest default) and `resolve_mode()` (explicit override wins). The
    `run_router` orchestration makes the cheap routing call (one fast model,
    `max_tokens≈5`) over an injected `Backend`/`CostMeter`, meters it, and emits a
    `route` event — **never an `answer`**; an explicit override short-circuits with
    no call and no spend.
  - `web/src/router.ts`: the UI↔wire mode mapping (`ask`/`panel`/`analyze` ↔
    `SYNTHESIS`/`DEBATE`/`ANALYSIS`) and override-precedence resolution for the
    explicit mode control.
  - Tests (fakes only): classification of tokens/cues/ambiguous input, override
    precedence, and that the routing call is metered, emits only `route`, and is
    skipped entirely when the user forces a mode.
- Phase 8 — agent path: AgentCore Runtime deploy stack (`infra/stacks/agent.py`):
  - `CfnRuntime` hosting the (already-built) Panel/Analyze/router orchestration as a
    framework-agnostic container, with `network_mode=PUBLIC` (no VPC) so it scales to
    zero with no idle clock; a `CfnRuntimeEndpoint`; and a `CfnCodeInterpreterCustom`
    (PUBLIC) sandbox for Analyze. L1 `Cfn*` (no L2 yet; migration tracked in #22).
  - Inbound auth via a Cognito `custom_jwt_authorizer` (OIDC discovery URL + app
    audience from deploy context) so the campus user's identity flows into the
    session; the Runtime's own execution role is the scoped outbound tool identity
    (Bedrock invoke + tenant S3 Vectors read). The agent container image and IdP
    coordinates are deploy-time context (PLACEHOLDER until supplied).
  - Wired into the CDK app; `cdk synth` verified for all four stacks (identity,
    data, lti, agent), with and without the Cognito authorizer context.

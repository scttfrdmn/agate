## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 0 — repository scaffold: CDK v2 Python app (`infra/`, `uv`-managed, Python 3.13),
  Go module for the `agg` CLI (`cli/`), Vite + TypeScript SPA skeleton (`web/`), and the
  component directories from design §11 (`policy/`, `cost/`, `meter/`, `lti/`, `agent/`,
  `ingest/`, `docs/`). `README.md`, this changelog, `.gitignore`, and `cdk bootstrap` notes.
- Phase 1 — identity broker + ABAC:
  - Pure, side-effect-free `claims_to_tags()` translation (the `agg:` session-tag scheme,
    §13.1) with full unit-test coverage and no AWS dependency.
  - Single-source-of-truth tier → entitled-model-ARN table, shared by the broker and the
    generated IAM model-access policy.
  - `infra/stacks/identity.py`: Cognito **Identity Pool** (federated SAML/OIDC, no User
    Pool), the authenticated role + permissions boundary keyed on `agg:` principal tags,
    and the per-request **broker Lambda** that validates the IdP token, derives the four
    tags, and vends scoped STS credentials.
  - Phase 1 end-to-end proof: IAM policy simulation asserting `Converse` is allowed for an
    entitled model ARN and denied for a non-entitled one, scoped purely by `agg:` tags.
